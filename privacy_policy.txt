Simply Art Privacy Policy

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.
I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
All data created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Yours sincerely, UnlucksMcgee.
